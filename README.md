# SonicCD SaveEditor - By Rubberduckycooly and Beta Angel

A save file editor for Sonic CD (2011)!

This program can edit all the values used by the game to save progress and settings (it does not edit time attack data!)
however, some values functions are unknown, but the program can modify them regardless...

My Github: you're on it lol
